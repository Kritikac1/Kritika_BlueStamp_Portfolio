# Solar Tracker 
Using photoresisors, servo motors and a solar panel my project becomes a solar tracker to measure the solar voltage of the sun by moving the base part which has the solar panel to areas with more sun.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
For my final milestone I have fully completed the solar tracker and added modifcations that help level up the base project. My biggest challenges throughout the Blue Stamp Engineering program was working on time management and thinking/implementing modifactions that I could add to my project. My biggest triumph throughout the project was getting my base project to work smoothly on my first try without having to disassemble big parts of it to fix it. Throughout the program I learned how to sucessfully code components that I added into my orginal project to the code, soldering, component wiring, and more. I hope to learn in the future more about mechanical engineering and electrical engineering as I learned the challenged myself with skills from both types of engineering throughout Blue Stamp.

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

 For my first milestone I used servos, batteries, an ardiuno, ardiuno shield, different screw types and more to power and build the 2 main parts of my solar tracker. The batteries help power the solar panel allowing it to move to spots that have a greater amount of sunlight. A challenge I noticed for future milestones is how I will use the pins covered by the ardiuno shield for future modifcations that will need the pins to connect to the ardiuno and solar tracker. My plan is to continue adding modifcations one of which will be creating a connection to charge phones and allowing the robot to move on wheels.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
